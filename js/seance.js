While some people might be naturally more susceptible to feeling embarrassed based on their innate disposition, societal norms and expectations play a significant role in determining how and when we experience embarrassment. In many cultures, for example, modesty is highly valued, which may lead individuals to feel embarrassed about displaying their achievements or qualities that might be seen as arrogance or prideful."\nletter_image9_shame8_answer4,"Your ideas remind me of the time when I was creating a portrait of a prominent politician in America - Theodore Roosevelt.

Josephson\'s private life was tumultuous, however; by his late twenties, he was affected by syphilis, his romantic life suffering as a result. He sufferred from delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness. He became involved in spiritism and while in his visionary states, he wrote poems and created paintings that he signed with the names of dead artists. Some of his best known and most influential works were created during this period.","This painting shows a scene from the street, Calle Gerona in Seville 1882. The beggar holds out his hand and tilts his head to the side as he is asking for alms. As other contemporary artists, Josephson went to Spain in order to find “exotic“ and artistically interesting motives, as well as studying the color and compositions of Spanish old masters.","This painting shows a scene from the street, Calle Gerona in Seville 1882.

Erik Sparre,(1665-1726),"The Monogrammist I.S. is an elusive figure who worked in the circle of Rembrandt and is believed to have worked in Leiden in the 1630s. His artistic identity was first established in 1904, based on a group of works signed with the monogram ‘I.S.’. Opinions vary as to whether he was originally a German, Baltic or a Dutch-born painter, but the consensus is that he worked in Leiden in the 1630s, as his refined, articulated brushwork, his subject-matter and his almost scientific realism reflect the influence of the then relatively unknown work of the young Rembrandt and other painters in his milieu. The earliest work by the Monogrammist I.S. is dated 1632, two years after Rembrandt’s departure for Amsterdam. His known oeuvre consists exclusively of portrayals of single figures, either ‘tronies’ or actual portraits. Despite his anonymity today, works by the Monogrammist I.S. have been much admired throughout history, as indicated by the illustrious early provenance of many of his works.","The subject of this painting is not really being a portrait of an individual, but a so called tronie. A tronie is an artistic study of expressions, types, physiognomy or an interesting character. In this case it is also an example of the interest in 16th and 17th century Europe in what deviated from the ordinary, such as this man’s growth on his nose. This interest had both a scientific and an artistic side.","The subject of this painting is not really being a portrait of an individual, but a so called tronie.

Några bilder med text""",Gunnar Sundgren,(1901–1970),"Gunnar Sundgren, born in 1901 and died in 1970, was a Swedish photographer. He grew up in a sibling group of nine children at a small railway station between Sala and Gävle. As a 21-year-old, Sundgren became a student of Ellen Claeson, the leading photographer in Uppsala. He opened a portrait studio and became one of Uppsala\'s foremost photographers during the 1940s–1950s. As well as portrait pictures made after personality studies, Sundgren produced significant environmental and architectural images. He appeared on radio as a strong agitator for photography as an art form.","The photographer Gunnar Sundgren was mainly active in the Swedish town Uppsala. In 1934 he published a book, I min kameras närhet (Close to my camera). The book is illustrated with 21 photographic portraits. No names of the sitters are given. Very few can be identified. They come from different groups of society – from university professors to poor old women. This woman seems to belong to the lower middel class. Since the 1920s Sander worked on an extensive documentation project, Menschen des 20. Jahrhundert (People of the 20th century), where he aimed to photograph all kinds of people in his contemporary society in their own surroundings.","The photographer Gunnar Sundgren was mainly active in the Swedish town Uppsala.
