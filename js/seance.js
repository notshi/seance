In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities.

The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen\'s art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher\'s works depict Skagen\'s heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art.","Michael Ancher was a prominent Danish artist known for his realistic paintings depicting the everyday life of fishermen and their families in the village of Skagen. Ancher\'s works often focused on the hardships and joys of life in a close-knit community, capturing the emotions and struggles of his subjects with great sensitivity and attention to detail. His paintings are characterized by their rich colors, dynamic compositions, and deep emotional resonance, making Ancher one of the most celebrated artists of the Skagen Painters group.","This small study shows two fishermen looking out towards the sea as if searching for their companions that are already out with their boats.

Initially Cornelis Cornelisz painted large-size, highly stylized works with Italianate nudes in twisted poses with a grotesque, unnatural anatomy. Later, his style changed to one based on the Netherlandish realist tradition. When his parents fled Haarlem, as the Spanish army laid siege to the city in 1573 during the Eighty Years\' War, Cornelis Cornelisz remained behind and was raised by the painter Pieter Pietersz the Elder, his first teacher.

Marstrand is one of the most renowned artists belonging to the Golden Age of Danish Painting. He studied at Copenhagen\'s Metropolitan School (Metropolitanskolen), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. A close friend of his father suggested an artistic career as he had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition. At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen\'s streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand\'s equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand\'s creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times.","Wilhelm Marstrand was a Danish painter and illustrator known for his detailed and colorful works depicting historical and cultural scenes.

Today too, these works, along with others, are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet\'s life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time; he developed his own simple and direct style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.","Édouard Manet was a French painter who played a crucial role in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.
