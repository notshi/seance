Despite this, he remained undecided as to whether he should pursue a career in lithography or strike out on his own as an artist.

He was known for his landscape paintings, particularly those depicting the natural beauty of the Swedish countryside. Wilhelmson was a prominent figure in the Swedish art world during his lifetime, and his work continues to be admired and studied today. His paintings often featured vibrant colors and expressive brushwork, capturing the essence of the Swedish landscape in a way that was both realistic and emotive. Wilhelmson\'s legacy as a painter lives on through his beautiful and evocative artworks, which showcase his deep connection to nature and his exceptional talent as an artist.\n","The old woman in the blue dress is the artist’s mother, depicted in her home.

They were not poor, but not especially well off either. In European painting to depict old people with a closed book or some other kind of work (here the knitting), which they are not actively working on, on their lap, is a common motif for depicting people in old age, getting nearer to death.

From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter.

The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen\'s art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher\'s works depict Skagen\'s heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art.","Michael Ancher was a prominent Danish artist known for his realistic paintings depicting the everyday life of fishermen and their families in the village of Skagen. Ancher\'s works often focused on the hardships and joys of life in a close-knit community, capturing the emotions and struggles of his subjects with great sensitivity and attention to detail. His paintings are characterized by their rich colors, dynamic compositions, and deep emotional resonance, making Ancher one of the most celebrated artists of the Skagen Painters group.","This small study shows two fishermen looking out towards the sea as if searching for their companions that are already out with their boats.

Marstrand is one of the most renowned artists belonging to the Golden Age of Danish Painting. He studied at Copenhagen\'s Metropolitan School (Metropolitanskolen), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. A close friend of his father suggested an artistic career as he had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition. At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen\'s streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand\'s equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand\'s creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times.","Wilhelm Marstrand was a Danish painter and illustrator known for his detailed and colorful works depicting historical and cultural scenes. He was a prominent figure in the Golden Age of Danish painting and was particularly skilled at capturing the essence of everyday life in his art. Marstrand\'s work often featured lively and engaging compositions, with a focus on human interactions and emotions.

A major breakthrough in his artistic career occurred in Paris, where he began concentrating on portraits, many of which depicted his peers and fellow Swedes in France. Josephson\'s private life was tumultuous, however; by his late twenties, he was affected by syphilis, his romantic life suffering as a result. He sufferred from delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness.

His known oeuvre consists exclusively of portrayals of single figures, either ‘tronies’ or actual portraits. The subject of this painting is not really a portrait of an individual, but a so called tronie, i.e. an artistic study of expressions, types, physiognomy or an interesting character.

He was born into a wealthy family at Haarlem, and spent his youth in his home town. Being of noble birth and with time on his hands, he took up painting mainly as a pastime. He was primarily responsible for introducing the classical revival style into Dutch Baroque architecture, combining the native, Dutch brick style with the Vitruvian principles he had learnt to produce ""Dutch Classicism"", an internationally influential style. Van Campen worked as an architect, a painter and a designer of decorative schemes, like that for the church organ in Alkmaar. His art also influenced sculpture. After a long career, Van Campen died in 1657 in his residence which he had inherited from his mother, and was buried there. Van Campen never married, but had one son.","Jacob van Campen was a Dutch artist and architect who played a significant role in the development of Dutch Golden Age architecture. He is best known for his work on the Royal Palace in Amsterdam, which is considered one of the most important buildings in the Netherlands. Van Campen\'s architectural style was characterized by its classicism and grandeur, and he was highly influential in shaping the architectural landscape of the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. His work continues to be admired and studied to this day for its innovative design and timeless beauty.","This Study of the head of an old woman might be a study for a larger composition or so called tronie, i.e. an artistic study of expressions, types, physiognomy or an interesting character, such as this old woman.","Jacob van Campen was active both as an architect and as a painter doing wallpaintings in buildings.

At 20, he traveled to Amsterdam where he learned how to paint and left his art studies 4 years later and moved to Skokloster Castle at the request of Swedish nobleman, Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Between 1654 and 1661 he studied in Italy and visited the courts of both France and England. On his return he became entitled Court painter and was raised to the nobility at which time he took the surname Ehrenstråhl. He made portraits of, among others, King Charles XI of Sweden. Ehrenstrahl also painted several ceilings and large wall pieces with allegoric motifs. The great hall ceiling fresco, named The Great Deeds of The Swedish Kings, is considered to be his greatest work. Ehrenstrahl is known for his proposal, in 1694, that ""Art presents riddles that could not be solved by everyone"".","David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl was a Swedish portrait painter, born in Hamburg in 1629. He was known for his refined style and his ability to capture the likeness and personality of his subjects. Ehrenstrahl painted many portraits of Swedish royalty and nobility, as well as religious and mythological scenes. He was also a skilled draftsman and engraver, and his work had a significant influence on the Swedish art world. Ehrenstrahl died in Stockholm in 1698, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful and iconic paintings that are still admired today.","The king Karl XI commissioned his court painter David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl to make a portrait of the dromedary and its driver.
