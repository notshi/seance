The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen\'s art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher\'s works depict Skagen\'s heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art.","Michael Ancher was a prominent Danish artist known for his realistic paintings depicting the everyday life of fishermen and their families in the village of Skagen. Ancher\'s works often focused on the hardships and joys of life in a close-knit community, capturing the emotions and struggles of his subjects with great sensitivity and attention to detail. His paintings are characterized by their rich colors, dynamic compositions, and deep emotional resonance, making Ancher one of the most celebrated artists of the Skagen Painters group.","This small study shows two fishermen looking out towards the sea as if searching for their companions that are already out with their boats.

On his return he became entitled Court painter and was raised to the nobility at which time he took the surname Ehrenstråhl. He made portraits of, among others, King Charles XI of Sweden. Ehrenstrahl also painted several ceilings and large wall pieces with allegoric motifs.

At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen\'s streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand\'s equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand\'s creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times.","Wilhelm Marstrand was a Danish painter and illustrator known for his detailed and colorful works depicting historical and cultural scenes.

He was a courtier, and is known for his diary and illustrations depicting the life of the Swedish court in the mid-19th century. Fritz von Dardel married the Swedish noble Augusta Silfverschiöld and became adjutant to the Crown Prince, later King Charles XV of Sweden, in 1850. He was a personal friend of Charles XV aside from having several court offices, and both professionally and privately he often attended court during the reign of Charles, and his published diary is a valuable description of the Swedish court and its personages in the mid 19th-century. Fritz von Dardel is known for his drawings and diary depicting the life at the contemporary Swedish royal court, especially during the reign of Charles XV. Many of von Dardel\'s caricatures were made in series in order to tell a (comic) story together with short accompanying texts. They were early examples of cartoon series, probably inspired by his Swiss compatriot Rodolphe Töpffer.","Fritz von Dardel was a Swedish painter and writer born in 1817. He was known for his landscapes and portraits, as well as his contributions to the cultural scene in Sweden. Dardel studied art in Paris and traveled extensively throughout Europe, gaining inspiration for his work. In addition to his artistic talents, he was also a skilled writer, penning numerous articles and essays on art and culture. Fritz von Dardel\'s legacy continues to live on through his paintings and writings, which are cherished by art enthusiasts and historians alike.","Both artist Fritz von Dardel and sitter John Panzio Tockson belonged to the court circles of the Swedish king Karl XV.

Zorn was born and raised on his grandparents\' farm in Yvraden, a hamlet near the village of Utmeland in the parish of Mora, Dalarna. Zorn studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where he amazed his teachers with his talent. Members of the Stockholm Society approached him with commissions. In early 1881, Zorn met Emma Lamm, whose background was quite different from his. Emma Lamm was from a wealthy Jewish merchant family. She was interested in art and culture and, after a long engagement, they were married in a civil ceremony in October 1885. Zorn traveled extensively, to London, Paris, the Balkans, Spain, Italy and the United States; he became an international success and one of the most highly regarded painters of his era. It was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim, based principally upon his incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model. His subjects included three American Presidents: Grover Cleveland, William H. Taft and Theodore Roosevelt.","Anders Zorn was a Swedish painter known for his skillful watercolor and oil paintings. His work often depicted scenes of everyday life in a realistic and detailed manner. Zorn\'s use of light and shadow added depth and emotion to his paintings, making them truly captivating. Zorn\'s talent and dedication to his craft solidified his reputation as one of the greatest artists of his time. His legacy continues to inspire artists and art enthusiasts around the world.","As several other artists, also Anders Zorn went to Spain during the late 19th century in order to find “exotic“ and artistically interesting motives, as well as studying the color and compositions of Spanish old masters like El Greco (1541-1614) and Diego Velázquez (1599-1660).

At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria\'s protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works.
