## Dead Painters Séance

The Dead Painters Séance is an exploration of using AI generative text to connect a modern audience to underrepresented people and groups of people in art.  
It uses content from the Nationalmuseum Sweden and is part of the [NEO Collections project](https://www.nationalmuseum.se/en/neo-collections-fellowship).

Dead Painters Séance is developed by Wetgenes, Prekshaa Malu & Priyanka Raju Parulekar.

Art historical information provided by Eva-Lena Karlsson, Nationalmuseum Sweden.

This [NEO Collections](https://medium.com/neocollections) project is a collaboration between the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, the Übersee-Museum Bremen and the Nationalmuseum in Sweden. Project leader at the Nationalmuseum is Eva-Maria Bongardt, Head of Digital Development. The project is based on the principles of open access and participation and strives to find new ways to engage with museum collections – both digitally and in the museum itself. The project focuses on free-licence, open-source and free software solutions. 

**NEO Collections** is funded by the German Federal Cultural Foundation as part of their Digital Culture programme. Funded by the German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media.
