letter_image1_grief3_answer2,"Thank you for your letter and for sharing your thoughts with me. I am touched by your words and can relate to the desire to embrace and find solace in the variations and advancements that we have experienced.

However, I must express my concern about the statement ""I opt for the variations and advancements I have experienced."" I believe it is important to approach life with a sense of balance and not solely focus on material advancements. It is equally important to find happiness and fulfillment in simpler things and to appreciate the beauty in the world around us.

I understand that life can be difficult at times and that depression can be a heavy burden to carry. I wish you the best of luck in finding a positive outlook and in finding balance in your life.

Sincerely,
Eva Bonnier"
