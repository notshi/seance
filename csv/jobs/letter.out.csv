letter_image1_grief3_answer1,"I understand your struggle with societal expectations and the stifling of your ability to openly grieve. It is important to find solace in embracing your emotions and allowing them to guide you through this challenging time. It is okay to feel angry and to channel that anger towards facing every challenge head-on. Remember that you are not silenced in your pain and that you have the strength to overcome.

As a fellow painter and philanthropist, I understand the importance of using art as a way to express oneself and connect with others. Perhaps finding a creative outlet, such as painting or writing, can help you process your grief and find the right words to convey your feelings.

Always remember that you are not alone in your struggles and that there are others who understand and support you. I hope that you find the strength to continue moving forward and to use your experiences to help others.

Sincerely,
Eva Bonnier"
