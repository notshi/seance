The original sentence is beautifully poetic but also can be slightly confusing due to the use of metaphors. It suggests that the person is baring their soul and wearing their emotions on their sleeve, which means being open about their feelings. The phrase ""the more you peel layers"" also refers to getting to know someone better by uncovering different aspects of their personality or experiences.

Here's another unsettling way to reword the statement:
""I fearfully welcome any secrets that others may uncover about me.""

It also shifts the focus from the person being afraid of others finding out about them, to the person willingly revealing their secrets, which can make for a very unsettling and intriguing statement"
