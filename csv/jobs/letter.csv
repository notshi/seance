artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren (1815-1875) was a Swedish painter and author known for his specialization in watercolors. After initially studying resource management, Lundgren pursued his childhood interest in watercolors by attending the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and later studying in Paris under Léon Cogniet. He spent significant time in Italy and Spain, producing historical and folkloric scenes in watercolors. Lundgren transitioned to genre scenes, capturing local life and festivities, during his time in Spain. In London, he focused on portrait painting and depicting Royal ceremonies and scenes from Shakespeare's plays. Lundgren also traveled extensively, including a trip to India during the Sepoy Mutiny, producing over 500 sketches and watercolors.

statements,"The persisting injustices against women in the contemporary world, which have been an issue historically, is a source of frustration for me.

image_description," "" John Panzio Tockson, footman at the court of Karl XV, King of Sweden and Norway "" , Both artist Fritz von Dardel and sitter John Panzio Tockson belonged to the court circles of the Swedish king Karl XV. It is not known exactly where Tockson was born, one suggestion is that he came from Africa, possibly from Madagascar. There is a hypothesis that he was sold as a slave, but managed to escape. What is known, is that he in the mid 19th century turns up in the Swedish harbour town Göteborg (Gothenburgh). Around 1860 he was employed as the personal footman of Karl XV, with special responsibility for the king’s hounds and horses. In Dardel’s drawing, Toxon stands next to one of the horses. The “exotic“ red livery and the fez were made especially for Tockson."
statements,"I feel selfish taking time out for myself. The thought of engaging in self-indulgent activities fills me with a sense of guilt, as if I am being selfish by neglecting my obligations or those who rely on me.

Self-care and prioritizing my own well-being leave me feeling torn, as the notion that I am focusing on myself seems to conflict with my duty to others and my responsibilities.
 The concept of dedicating time solely to my own needs and desires leaves me feeling uneasy, as if I am neglecting others or my responsibilities."

artist_description,"Alf Wallander (1862-1914) played a crucial role in shaping Swedish design as it transitioned into Art Nouveau. Wallander was known for creating decorative arts that embodied the flowing lines and organic themes typical of the movement. Some of his most renowned works include the ""Iris"" vase and the ""Swan"" service set, which were manufactured by Rörstrand porcelain. These pieces not only showcase Wallander's inventive design sensibilities but also his dedication to merging art into everyday items. His influence persists in Scandinavian design, where his accomplishments continue to be admired for their artistic and historical importance.

statements,"Hatred is a choice and one can behave differently than they feel. Although hatred may be an intense emotion that arises within us, it is still within our power to choose how we respond and act toward others.
 Despite the all-consuming nature of hatred, it remains a choice that each individual possesses the power to overcome and replace with different actions. I believe that hatred is a choice and one can act in ways that differ from how they feel. I am a firm believer in the notion that anger is an elective and one can conduct themselves differently than they are feeling."

statements,"Prejudice is learnt and one has limited control.  The development of prejudices is influenced by various external factors making them deeply ingrained and difficult to change. Prejudices are formed through experiences and influences in our environment, shaping our perceptions of others and limiting our understanding and control over our own biases.
 Prejudice is learned, thus limiting the extent of individual control over their formation and expression. Prejudice is not an inherent trait, but a learned behaviour and one has limited control over it."
