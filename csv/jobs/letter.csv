artist_description,"Carl Wilhelm Wilhelmson, born in 1866 and died in 1928, was a Swedish painter, graphic artist, amateur photographer and art teacher. His father died in a shipwreck in 1875 so his mother opened a small shop to support the family. At 15, he was apprenticed to the lithographers Meyer & Köster in Gothenburg. At 22, he was awarded a scholarship that enabled him to travel to Leipzig to work for several notable lithography firms. Despite this, he remained undecided as to whether he should pursue a career in lithography or strike out on his own as an artist. After 6 years in Paris working as an advertising artist, he returned to Sweden to become the Director at the Valand Academy for 5 years before opening his own art school."
statements,"I believe life is about living in the moment and making a genuine impact on those around us, rather than seeking validation through being remembered after death. I don't long for an eternal legacy; my focus lies in living meaningfully and leaving behind a positive impact on the world and those around me. I find solace in the idea that, whether remembered or forgotten, my life will have ultimately contributed to something greater than myself. I live each day to its fullest, for the world is my canvas and every moment an opportunity to create. I seek to live a meaningful life guided by passion and purpose, rather than focusing on whether my existence will be immortalized through memory."

From 1901 until his death, he was a professor at the School of Fine Arts of Malaga in several subjects, and he held the chair of Concepts of Art and History of Decorative Arts at the School of Fine Arts of Seville from 1919 to 1921. A broad artistic culture, he was an academic at San Telmo de Málaga from 1911 and a businessman, since he had the most important decorative painting workshop in Málaga at his time. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce."

I hope when I'm gone, my macabre artistry will linger, an eerie testament to the darkness within me. I'd like to be remembered as an innovator who left the world better than I found it."

After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors.

From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works.

In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."
statements,Women have died old and alone for centuries so there’s nothing to be scared of. I have always been drawn to the idea that every woman's life is a tale filled with sorrowful echoes of forgotten names. I recognize the historical challenges women have faced but choose to focus on empowering their potential for growth and resilience in the face of adversity.

statements,"I am intrigued by the concept of women surpassing men in longevity and how it challenges societal norms and interdependence. I find the gender disparity in longevity an intriguing perspective to examine societal influences on well-being and health, prompting further exploration. I find women living longer than men a thought-provoking exploration into our collective mortality, and eager to delve into the complexity of age, health, and societal expectations. I'm intrigued that women live longer than men; it opens up discussions around societal factors, healthcare disparities, and the potential implications for loneliness in later life."

statements,I feel children today are blessed with more opportunities and resources; it's important for them to recognize in their lives rather than being consumed by negative news. I think it's crucial to acknowledge the emotional challenges they face and help them navigate through the constant stream of information without becoming overwhelmed. Children should be grateful for the abundance of opportunities available to them and focus on positivity instead of falling into the trap of doomscrolling.

artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren, born in 1815 and died in 1875, was a Swedish painter and author who specialized in watercolors. At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely.

artist_description,"Nils Forsberg, born in 17 December 1842 and died in 8 November 1934, was a Swedish painter who lived and worked in Paris for much of his career. Forsberg was born in a small village called Riseberga, in the province of Scania. The son of a peasant, he spent his early years in farming, then was apprenticed to a house-painter at Göteborg. He made a statue of Minerva which procured for him a government stipend which enabled him to go to Paris where he became a student in the atelier of Léon Bonnat. The siege of Paris, during which he enlisted in the Ambulance Department, afforded him opportunities for studying and sketching the scenes that he observed."
statements,Women have died old and alone for centuries so there’s nothing to be scared of. I have always been drawn to the idea that every woman's life is a tale filled with sorrowful echoes of forgotten names. I recognize the historical challenges women have faced but choose to focus on empowering their potential for growth and resilience in the face of adversity.

statements,"I am intrigued by the concept of women surpassing men in longevity and how it challenges societal norms and interdependence. I find the gender disparity in longevity an intriguing perspective to examine societal influences on well-being and health, prompting further exploration. I find women living longer than men a thought-provoking exploration into our collective mortality, and eager to delve into the complexity of age, health, and societal expectations. I'm intrigued that women live longer than men; it opens up discussions around societal factors, healthcare disparities, and the potential implications for loneliness in later life."

statements,I feel children today are blessed with more opportunities and resources; it's important for them to recognize in their lives rather than being consumed by negative news. I think it's crucial to acknowledge the emotional challenges they face and help them navigate through the constant stream of information without becoming overwhelmed. Children should be grateful for the abundance of opportunities available to them and focus on positivity instead of falling into the trap of doomscrolling.

artist_description,"Michael Peter Ancher, born in 1849 and died in 1927, was a Danish realist artist, and widely known for his paintings of fishermen, the Skagerak and the North Sea, and other scenes from the Danish fishing community in Skagen. The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen's art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher's works depict Skagen's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art."

The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen's art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher's works depict Skagen's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art."

artist_name,David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl
artist_description,"David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl, born in 1628 and died in 1698, was a Swedish nobleman and portrait painter. At 20, he traveled to Amsterdam where he learned how to paint and left his art studies 4 years later and moved to Skokloster Castle at the request of Swedish nobleman, Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Between 1654 and 1661 he studied in Italy and visited the courts of both France and England. On his return he became entitled Court painter and was raised to the nobility at which time he took the surname Ehrenstråhl. He made portraits of, among others, King Charles XI of Sweden. Ehrenstrahl also painted several ceilings and large wall pieces with allegoric motifs. The great hall ceiling fresco, named The Great Deeds of The Swedish Kings, is considered to be his greatest work. Ehrenstrahl is known for his proposal, in 1694, that ""Art presents riddles that could not be solved by everyone""."
statements,"I am intrigued by the concept of women surpassing men in longevity and how it challenges societal norms and interdependence. I find the gender disparity in longevity an intriguing perspective to examine societal influences on well-being and health, prompting further exploration. I find women living longer than men a thought-provoking exploration into our collective mortality, and eager to delve into the complexity of age, health, and societal expectations. I'm intrigued that women live longer than men; it opens up discussions around societal factors, healthcare disparities, and the potential implications for loneliness in later life."

statements,"I am both captivated and disturbed by the prospect of witnessing an increasingly chaotic and diverse existence as the boundaries between life and death blur. I feel that there is a growing number of opportunities and experiences in the world so living longer does not scare me. I believe that as our world expands with new possibilities, living a longer life filled with amazing adventures brings excitement rather than fear. I believe that with each passing day, our understanding of the world expands, enriching our lives and empowers us to embrace the prospect of an extended lifespan. I embrace the abundance of possibilities, relishing in the idea that each day brings new experiences and challenges that contribute to my ever-evolving journey."

In early 1881, Zorn met Emma Lamm, whose background was quite different from his. Emma Lamm was from a wealthy Jewish merchant family.

Zorn traveled extensively, to London, Paris, the Balkans, Spain, Italy and the United States; he became an international success and one of the most highly regarded painters of his era. It was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim, based principally upon his incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model. His subjects included three American Presidents: Grover Cleveland, William H. Taft and Theodore Roosevelt."

artist_name,Cornelis Cornelisz. van Harlem
artist_description,"Cornelis van Haarlem, born in 1562 and died in 11 November 1638, was a Dutch Golden Age painter and draughtsman. He was one of the leading Northern Mannerist artists in the Netherlands, and an important forerunner of Frans Hals as a portraitist. He painted mainly portraits as well as mythological and Biblical subjects. Initially Cornelis Cornelisz painted large-size, highly stylized works with Italianate nudes in twisted poses with a grotesque, unnatural anatomy. Later, his style changed to one based on the Netherlandish realist tradition. When his parents fled Haarlem, as the Spanish army laid siege to the city in 1573 during the Eighty Years' War, Cornelis Cornelisz remained behind and was raised by the painter Pieter Pietersz the Elder, his first teacher. He became a respected member of the community and later became the city painter of Haarlem, receiving numerous official commissions."
statements,I believe that embracing vulnerability and facing challenges head-on can lead to immense growth and positive transformation. I believe that turning shame into strength is an empowering and transformative journey. I believe there is value in embracing vulnerability and turning experiences into growth opportunities.

artist_description,"Albert Laurentius Johannes Engström, born in 1869 and died in 1940, was a Swedish cartoonist, painter and writer. Engström was a very skilled cartoonist, and his comic drawings were published in newspapers and later his own newspaper, Strix, which made him famous. He made many caricatures of the authorities of the time, including priests, citizens and officers. In 1925, he became acting professor of drawing at the Academy of Arts and worked there until 1935. He was involved in the Referendum on the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in Sweden in 1922, a commitment that resulted in the poster, ""Crabs demand these drinks!"". Engström entered the Svea Orden in 1917 and remained a brother for the rest of his life. Engström spent a lot of time on Gotska Sandön, and he has written one of the most comprehensive works about the island. In the spring of 1938, Engström's eyesight deteriorated so strongly that he was gradually forced to stop working."

artist_name,Wilhelm Marstrand
artist_description,"Nicolai Wilhelm Marstrand, born in 1810 and died in 1873, was a Danish painter and illustrator. Marstrand is one of the most renowned artists belonging to the Golden Age of Danish Painting. He studied at Copenhagen's Metropolitan School (Metropolitanskolen), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. A close friend of his father suggested an artistic career as he had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition. At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen's streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand's equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand's creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times."

He studied at Copenhagen's Metropolitan School (Metropolitanskolen), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. A close friend of his father suggested an artistic career as he had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition. At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen's streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand's equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand's creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times."

artist_description,"Ernst Josephson, born in 1851 and died in 1906, was a Swedish painter and poet. He specialized in portraits, genre scenes of folklife and folklore. He was born to a middle-class family of merchants of Jewish ancestry. When he was ten, his father left home and he was raised by his mother and three older sisters. With his family's support, Josephson began to pursue art professionally at the age of sixteen, enrolling at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts where he received a Royal Medal for painting. A major breakthrough in his artistic career occurred in Paris, where he began concentrating on portraits, many of which depicted his peers and fellow Swedes in France. Josephson's private life was tumultuous, however; by his late twenties, he was affected by syphilis, his romantic life suffering as a result. He sufferred from delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness. He became involved in spiritism and while in his visionary states, he wrote poems and created paintings that he signed with the names of dead artists. Some of his best known and most influential works were created during this period."

artist_name,Monogrammist I.S. Erik Sparre
artist_description,"The Monogrammist I.S. is an elusive figure who worked in the circle of Rembrandt and is believed to have worked in Leiden in the 1630s. His artistic identity was first established in 1904, based on a group of works signed with the monogram ‘I.S.’. Opinions vary as to whether he was originally a German, Baltic or a Dutch-born painter, but the consensus is that he worked in Leiden in the 1630s, as his refined, articulated brushwork, his subject-matter and his almost scientific realism reflect the influence of the then relatively unknown work of the young Rembrandt and other painters in his milieu. The earliest work by the Monogrammist I.S. is dated 1632, two years after Rembrandt’s departure for Amsterdam. His known oeuvre consists exclusively of portrayals of single figures, either ‘tronies’ or actual portraits. Despite his anonymity today, works by the Monogrammist I.S. have been much admired throughout history, as indicated by the illustrious early provenance of many of his works."

His artistic identity was first established in 1904, based on a group of works signed with the monogram ‘I.S.’. Opinions vary as to whether he was originally a German, Baltic or a Dutch-born painter, but the consensus is that he worked in Leiden in the 1630s, as his refined, articulated brushwork, his subject-matter and his almost scientific realism reflect the influence of the then relatively unknown work of the young Rembrandt and other painters in his milieu. The earliest work by the Monogrammist I.S. is dated 1632, two years after Rembrandt’s departure for Amsterdam. His known oeuvre consists exclusively of portrayals of single figures, either ‘tronies’ or actual portraits. Despite his anonymity today, works by the Monogrammist I.S. have been much admired throughout history, as indicated by the illustrious early provenance of many of his works."

At the end of his life, he established the Swedish literary Bellman Prize in 1920. Zorn was born and raised on his grandparents' farm in Yvraden, a hamlet near the village of Utmeland in the parish of Mora, Dalarna. Zorn studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where he amazed his teachers with his talent. Members of the Stockholm Society approached him with commissions. In early 1881, Zorn met Emma Lamm, whose background was quite different from his. Emma Lamm was from a wealthy Jewish merchant family. She was interested in art and culture and, after a long engagement, they were married in a civil ceremony in October 1885. Zorn traveled extensively, to London, Paris, the Balkans, Spain, Italy and the United States; he became an international success and one of the most highly regarded painters of his era. It was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim, based principally upon his incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model.

Zorn was born and raised on his grandparents' farm in Yvraden, a hamlet near the village of Utmeland in the parish of Mora, Dalarna. Zorn studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where he amazed his teachers with his talent. Members of the Stockholm Society approached him with commissions. In early 1881, Zorn met Emma Lamm, whose background was quite different from his. Emma Lamm was from a wealthy Jewish merchant family. She was interested in art and culture and, after a long engagement, they were married in a civil ceremony in October 1885. Zorn traveled extensively, to London, Paris, the Balkans, Spain, Italy and the United States; he became an international success and one of the most highly regarded painters of his era. It was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim, based principally upon his incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model.

artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren, born in 1815 and died in 1875, was a Swedish painter and author who specialized in watercolors. At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."

artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren, born in 1815 and died in 1875, was a Swedish painter and author who specialized in watercolors. At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company.

In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."

artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren, born in 1815 and died in 1875, was a Swedish painter and author who specialized in watercolors. At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors.

He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, as well as a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.

His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) or Olympia, ""premiering"" in 1863 and '65, respectively, caused great controversy with both critics and the Academy of Fine Arts, but soon were praised by progressive artists as the breakthrough acts to the new style, Impressionism. Today too, these works, along with others, are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time; he developed his own simple and direct style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters."
