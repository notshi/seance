He perfected his studies in Madrid with Moreno Carbonero, who was a professor at the Special School of Painting, Sculpture and Engraving, of whom he considered himself a lifelong disciple and friend. At 25, he undertook a trip through Europe that took him to Stockholm, where he remained for a year, and where he carried out many commissions and, above all, portraits of members of the Swedish bourgeoisie, among them that of the bishop of Stockholm. From 1901 until his death, he was a professor at the School of Fine Arts of Malaga in several subjects, and he held the chair of Concepts of Art and History of Decorative Arts at the School of Fine Arts of Seville from 1919 to 1921.

At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."

artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren, born in 1815 and died in 1875, was a Swedish painter and author who specialized in watercolors. At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny.

artist_description,"Nils Forsberg, born in 17 December 1842 and died in 8 November 1934, was a Swedish painter who lived and worked in Paris for much of his career. Forsberg was born in a small village called Riseberga, in the province of Scania. The son of a peasant, he spent his early years in farming, then was apprenticed to a house-painter at Göteborg. He made a statue of Minerva which procured for him a government stipend which enabled him to go to Paris where he became a student in the atelier of Léon Bonnat. The siege of Paris, during which he enlisted in the Ambulance Department, afforded him opportunities for studying and sketching the scenes that he observed."
statements,"I have always been hesitant to speak up for myself, fearing the repercussions of asserting my identity. However, I now understand that silence only perpetuates the cycle of oppression and violence. I hope to find the courage within myself to stand up for what I believe in, even if it means facing the risk of violence."

artist_description,"Michael Peter Ancher, born in 1849 and died in 1927, was a Danish realist artist, and widely known for his paintings of fishermen, the Skagerak and the North Sea, and other scenes from the Danish fishing community in Skagen. The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen's art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher's works depict Skagen's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art."

At the end of his life, he established the Swedish literary Bellman Prize in 1920. Zorn was born and raised on his grandparents' farm in Yvraden, a hamlet near the village of Utmeland in the parish of Mora, Dalarna.

He made many caricatures of the authorities of the time, including priests, citizens and officers. In 1925, he became acting professor of drawing at the Academy of Arts and worked there until 1935. He was involved in the Referendum on the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in Sweden in 1922, a commitment that resulted in the poster, ""Crabs demand these drinks!"". Engström entered the Svea Orden in 1917 and remained a brother for the rest of his life. Engström spent a lot of time on Gotska Sandön, and he has written one of the most comprehensive works about the island. In the spring of 1938, Engström's eyesight deteriorated so strongly that he was gradually forced to stop working."

artist_description,"Nicolai Wilhelm Marstrand, born in 1810 and died in 1873, was a Danish painter and illustrator. Marstrand is one of the most renowned artists belonging to the Golden Age of Danish Painting. He studied at Copenhagen's Metropolitan School (Metropolitanskolen), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. A close friend of his father suggested an artistic career as he had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition. At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen's streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand's equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand's creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times."

With his family's support, Josephson began to pursue art professionally at the age of sixteen, enrolling at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts where he received a Royal Medal for painting. A major breakthrough in his artistic career occurred in Paris, where he began concentrating on portraits, many of which depicted his peers and fellow Swedes in France. Josephson's private life was tumultuous, however; by his late twenties, he was affected by syphilis, his romantic life suffering as a result. He sufferred from delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness. He became involved in spiritism and while in his visionary states, he wrote poems and created paintings that he signed with the names of dead artists. Some of his best known and most influential works were created during this period."

artist_name,Monogrammist I.S. Erik Sparre
artist_description,"The Monogrammist I.S. is an elusive figure who worked in the circle of Rembrandt and is believed to have worked in Leiden in the 1630s. His artistic identity was first established in 1904, based on a group of works signed with the monogram ‘I.S.’. Opinions vary as to whether he was originally a German, Baltic or a Dutch-born painter, but the consensus is that he worked in Leiden in the 1630s, as his refined, articulated brushwork, his subject-matter and his almost scientific realism reflect the influence of the then relatively unknown work of the young Rembrandt and other painters in his milieu. The earliest work by the Monogrammist I.S. is dated 1632, two years after Rembrandt’s departure for Amsterdam. His known oeuvre consists exclusively of portrayals of single figures, either ‘tronies’ or actual portraits. Despite his anonymity today, works by the Monogrammist I.S. have been much admired throughout history, as indicated by the illustrious early provenance of many of his works."

artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren, born in 1815 and died in 1875, was a Swedish painter and author who specialized in watercolors. At 14, he studied at the Teknologiska institutet with a focus on ""bergshantering"" (a form of resource management). After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors. He studied there until 1839, then went to Paris, where he copied paintings in the Louvre and took advanced courses in the studios of Léon Cogniet. From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."

Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter. He also portrayed Royal ceremonies at court and produced scenes from the plays of Shakespeare. With London as his base, he travelled widely. In 1858, a company in Manchester engaged him to visit India and make sketches of the Sepoy Mutiny. Under Queen Victoria's protection, he was able to travel with the British Army, which had taken over military operations from the East India Company. He stayed for a year, until the rebellion was over; creating more than 500 drawings and watercolors, as well as a few oil paintings. They became some of his best known works. His final years were all spent at home, in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."

As a result, I have developed an understanding that prejudice is not only learned, but also something that can be unlearned through exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences. While one may have limited control over the prejudices of others, I believe that each individual has the power to choose how they respond to these prejudices and to work towards creating a more accepting and inclusive society."

After a long career, Van Campen died in 1657 in his residence which he had inherited from his mother, and was buried there. Van Campen never married, but had one son."
