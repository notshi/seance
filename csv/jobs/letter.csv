They were not poor, but not especially well off either. In European painting to depict old people with a closed book or some other kind of work (here the knitting), which they are not actively working on, on their lap, is a common motif for depicting people in old age, getting nearer to death. Wilhelmson’s painting is both a motif in this older tradition as a somehow realistic painting of an old woman, tired after having worked her entire life."
statements,"I understand that life on Earth is fleeting, and that our time on this planet is limited. However, I believe that our impact and the memories we create during our time here are what truly matter. I value the connections I have made with others and the experiences we share together, and I hope to make a positive difference in the lives of those around me. Whether I am remembered or not is ultimately inconsequential, as my focus remains on living a fulfilling and meaningful life in the present moment."

After initially studying resource management, Lundgren pursued his childhood interest in watercolors by attending the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and later studying in Paris under Léon Cogniet. He spent significant time in Italy and Spain, producing historical and folkloric scenes in watercolors. Lundgren transitioned to genre scenes, capturing local life and festivities, during his time in Spain. In London, he focused on portrait painting and depicting Royal ceremonies and scenes from Shakespeare's plays.

artist_name,Egron Lundgren
artist_description,"Egron Sellif Lundgren (1815-1875) was a Swedish painter and author known for his specialization in watercolors. After initially studying resource management, Lundgren pursued his childhood interest in watercolors by attending the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and later studying in Paris under Léon Cogniet. He spent significant time in Italy and Spain, producing historical and folkloric scenes in watercolors. Lundgren transitioned to genre scenes, capturing local life and festivities, during his time in Spain. In London, he focused on portrait painting and depicting Royal ceremonies and scenes from Shakespeare's plays. Lundgren also traveled extensively, including a trip to India during the Sepoy Mutiny, producing over 500 sketches and watercolors. His later years were spent in Stockholm, where he painted landscapes and published a collection of his letters and diaries."
image_description," "" Bedouin loading a gun "" , When the drawing was acquired by the Nationalmuseum in 1921, the title it was registered under was “Indier” or 'A man from India'. In the catalogue of the Nationalmuseum’s exhibition with works by Egron Lundgren in 1995, the caption is “Soldat som ladder ett gevär” or 'A soldier loading a gun', and it is mentioned among the drawings made in India 1858-59, from the seat of war in the aftermaths of the Indian Rebellion 1857. It is slightly confusing that the title has been changed to “Bedouin”, which might indicate that somebody has identified this as a later drawing from Lundgren’s travels to Egypt in 1861 and 1871, instead of his journey to India. Unfortunately, no reason for changing the title is given in the inventory or in the collection database."

Born in Riseberga in 1842 to a peasant family, he initially worked in farming before becoming an apprentice to a house-painter in Göteborg. His talent was recognized when he created a statue of Minerva, earning him a government stipend to study in Paris under Léon Bonnat. During the siege of Paris, Forsberg enlisted in the Ambulance Department, where he had the chance to study and sketch the scenes around him."

It is not known exactly where Tockson was born, one suggestion is that he came from Africa, possibly from Madagascar. There is a hypothesis that he was sold as a slave, but managed to escape. What is known, is that he in the mid 19th century turns up in the Swedish harbour town Göteborg (Gothenburgh). Around 1860 he was employed as the personal footman of Karl XV, with special responsibility for the king’s hounds and horses. In Dardel’s drawing, Toxon stands next to one of the horses. The “exotic“ red livery and the fez were made especially for Tockson."
