At 22, he was awarded a scholarship that enabled him to travel to Leipzig to work for several notable lithography firms. Despite this, he remained undecided as to whether he should pursue a career in lithography or strike out on his own as an artist.

After graduating, he worked at the cannon foundry in Finspång but the type of work was apparently not to his liking. In 1835, he enrolled at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to pursue a childhood interest in watercolors.

From 1841 to 1849, he lived in Italy; mostly with the Scandinavian community in Rome, then spent four years in Spain. In both places, he produced historical and folkloric scenes; mostly done in watercolors. Thanks to scholarships from the Royal Academy, he was also able to spend some time studying in Munich and Vienna. In Spain, he largely abandoned oil painting and gave up the idea of being a history painter. Instead, he focused on genre scenes, featuring the local people, market life and public festivities. In 1850, he became a member of the Royal Academy and was offered a professorship in 1853. Instead, he accepted an invitation from friends to come to London, where he lived until 1867, working primarily as a portrait painter.

Study,Michael Ancher,(1849-1927),"Michael Peter Ancher, born in 1849 and died in 1927, was a Danish realist artist, and widely known for his paintings of fishermen, the Skagerak and the North Sea, and other scenes from the Danish fishing community in Skagen. The son of a local merchant, he attended school in Rønne but was unable to complete his secondary education as his father ran into financial difficulties, forcing him to fend for himself. In 1865, he found work as an apprentice clerk. The following year, he met the painters Theodor Philipsen and Vilhelm Groth who had arrived in the area to paint. Impressed with his own early work, they encouraged him to take up painting as a profession. At 22, he spent a short period at C.V Nielsen's art school as a preliminary to joining the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen later in the year. Although he spent some time at the academy, he left 4 years later without graduating. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where Skagerak and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters. He later settled there joining the growing society of artists. Michael Ancher's works depict Skagen's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining realism and classical composition. Michael Ancher was influenced by his traditional training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in the 1870s which imposed strict rules for composition. His marriage to Anna Ancher did, however, introduce him to the naturalistic concept of undecorated reproduction of reality and its colours. By combining the pictorial composition of his youth with the teachings of naturalism, Michael Ancher created what has been called modern monumental figurative art.","Michael Ancher was a prominent Danish artist known for his realistic paintings depicting the everyday life of fishermen and their families in the village of Skagen. Ancher's works often focused on the hardships and joys of life in a close-knit community, capturing the emotions and struggles of his subjects with great sensitivity and attention to detail. His paintings are characterized by their rich colors, dynamic compositions, and deep emotional resonance, making Ancher one of the most celebrated artists of the Skagen Painters group.","This small study shows two fishermen looking out towards the sea as if searching for their companions that are already out with their boats.

He painted mainly portraits as well as mythological and Biblical subjects. Initially Cornelis Cornelisz painted large-size, highly stylized works with Italianate nudes in twisted poses with a grotesque, unnatural anatomy. Later, his style changed to one based on the Netherlandish realist tradition. When his parents fled Haarlem, as the Spanish army laid siege to the city in 1573 during the Eighty Years' War, Cornelis Cornelisz remained behind and was raised by the painter Pieter Pietersz the Elder, his first teacher.

He studied at Copenhagen's Metropolitan School (Metropolitanskolen), but had little interest in books, and left around 16 years of age. A close friend of his father suggested an artistic career as he had already shown artistic talent, tackling difficult subjects such as group scenes with many figures and complicated composition. At 16, Marstrand began his studies at the Academy under Eckersberg, attending the school from 1826 to 1833. Although his interests had a firm hold in genre themes – depiction of the daily life he observed around him in Copenhagen's streets, especially middle-class society – he would soon reach for the pinnacle of academic acceptability: the history painting. History painting displayed what was grand – classical themes from mythology and history, rather than daily life. The traditions, and the taste of traditional art critics, strongly favored it. It was therefore something to strive for, in spite of Marstrand's equal skill at depicting more modest themes, and of the enjoyment he had in portraying the crowds, the diversions of the city, and the humor and story behind the hustle and bustle. Marstrand's creative production would, through many paintings and illustrations made not only during the 1830s but throughout his life, never abandon this inclination toward displaying the simple life of his times.","Wilhelm Marstrand was a Danish painter and illustrator known for his detailed and colorful works depicting historical and cultural scenes.

When he was ten, his father left home and he was raised by his mother and three older sisters. With his family's support, Josephson began to pursue art professionally at the age of sixteen, enrolling at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts where he received a Royal Medal for painting. A major breakthrough in his artistic career occurred in Paris, where he began concentrating on portraits, many of which depicted his peers and fellow Swedes in France. Josephson's private life was tumultuous, however; by his late twenties, he was affected by syphilis, his romantic life suffering as a result. He sufferred from delusions and hallucinations, brought on by the progression of his illness. He became involved in spiritism and while in his visionary states, he wrote poems and created paintings that he signed with the names of dead artists.

Opinions vary as to whether he was originally a German, Baltic or a Dutch-born painter, but the consensus is that he worked in Leiden in the 1630s, as his refined, articulated brushwork, his subject-matter and his almost scientific realism reflect the influence of the then relatively unknown work of the young Rembrandt and other painters in his milieu. The earliest work by the Monogrammist I.S. is dated 1632, two years after Rembrandt’s departure for Amsterdam.

image22,artist22,hate,[],Les gitanos,Édouard Manet,(1832-1883),"Édouard Manet, born in 1832 and died in 1883, was a French modernist painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, as well as a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the naval career originally envisioned for him and became engrossed in the world of painting. His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) or Olympia, ""premiering"" in 1863 and '65, respectively, caused great controversy with both critics and the Academy of Fine Arts, but soon were praised by progressive artists as the breakthrough acts to the new style, Impressionism. Today too, these works, along with others, are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time; he developed his own simple and direct style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.","Édouard Manet was a French painter who played a crucial role in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. Known for his innovative style and controversial subject matter, Manet's work often challenged traditional artistic conventions. His masterpiece, ""Olympia,"" sparked outrage for its depiction of a nude woman staring directly at the viewer. Despite facing criticism during his lifetime, Manet's bold and revolutionary approach to art paved the way for future generations of artists.","“Gitano” is a Spanish expression for a member of the Romani people.
