Later, his style changed to one based on the Netherlandish realist tradition.

Erik Sparre,(1665-1726),https://www.nicholashall.art/artist/monogrammist-i-s/,"The Monogrammist I.S. is an elusive figure who worked in the circle of Rembrandt and is believed to have worked in Leiden in the 1630s. His artistic identity was first established in 1904, based on a group of works signed with the monogram ‘I.S.’. Opinions vary as to whether he was originally a German, Baltic or a Dutch-born painter, but the consensus is that he worked in Leiden in the 1630s, as his refined, articulated brushwork, his subject-matter and his almost scientific realism reflect the influence of the then relatively unknown work of the young Rembrandt and other painters in his milieu. The earliest work by the Monogrammist I.S. is dated 1632, two years after Rembrandt’s departure for Amsterdam. His known oeuvre consists exclusively of portrayals of single figures, either ‘tronies’ or actual portraits. Despite his anonymity today, works by the Monogrammist I.S. have been much admired throughout history, as indicated by the illustrious early provenance of many of his works.","The subject of this painting is not really being a portrait of an individual, but a so called tronie. A tronie is an artistic study of expressions, types, physiognomy or an interesting character.
