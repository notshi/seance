Dear friend,


I'm writing to you from a time when life was simpler and yet so much more difficult at the same time. I've been gone for many years now, but your letter has reached me through some magical means. It seems that our lives are quite different from each other, but there is one thing we share: grief.


The gypsy in my painting is a symbol of melancholy and longing, much like the pain you are feeling now. You may not think it, but your grief is valuable and should be cherished as a part of your journey through life. It's normal to feel angry or unjustified in our emotions, but remember that these feelings can lead us to growth and understanding.


As for being remembered after death, I often pondered on this myself. While it is nice to be remembered, what truly matters are the connections we make with others during our lives. These relationships are like lanterns that can light our way through dark times, even when the candles have burnt out.


I hope you find comfort in your grief, and remember that it's okay not to be angry or compare yourself to others. Cherish the time you had with those who have passed on and use their memories to guide you through your own journey.


With love and understanding,

Hugo Birger
