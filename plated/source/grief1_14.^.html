			The painting is dated 1885. At that time Mina Carlson-Bredberg studied at Academie Julian in Paris. Below her signature “Mina Bredberg 1885” (in the lower left corner), the artist has written that this is a profile of the same model for which she had received a prize [a prize given for another painting or drawing]. This painting is rather typical for the kind of studies that the pupils at the art schools made at that time. We don’t know if this model worked for Academie Julian or was hired privately by Mina Bredberg.
